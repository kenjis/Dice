Dice
====

Dice is a minimalist Dependency Injection Container for PHP.

FORK
====
This is a fork I created to port the code to be a composer package and PSR-0
compliant. Also I plan on adding full tests all classes


Installation
------------

Just require dice.php in your project and you're good to go.
